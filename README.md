I completed a 3-month summer internship from June 2019 to September 2019 with **The Insight Centre for Data Analytics in DCU**. This repository contains the work that I completed throughout the course of this intership.

This work includes a project I worked on as part of *The Croke Park smart stadium project* which focuses on using sensors, cameras and other technological innovations in conjuction with machine learning and other agorithms to make the Croke Park stadium smarter with respect to resource efficiency, crowd safety and general crowd satisfaction.

The particular aspect that I worked on as part of this was to do with monitoring and visualising the density of the crowd in different parts of the stadium based off of the camera footage in these areas. Prior to my work, this was done manually in an unaccurate way, however, my job was to automate this process and present the information in a user friendly way to ease the process.

This project then enabled security and other stadium managers to easily manage crowd movements throughout the stadium.
