I completed a 3-month summer internship from June 2019 to September 2019 with The Insight Centre for Data Analytics in DCU
I worked on a project in conjunction with the Croke Park smart stadium project to do with monitoring and visualising the crowd densities of different parts of the stadium based off of the camera footage.
This repository contains the work I did in relation to that project
